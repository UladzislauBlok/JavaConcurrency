/**
 * While no method explicitly acquires two locks, callers of setLocation and getImage can acquire two locks just the same. If a thread calls setLocation in response to an update from a GPS receiver, it first updates the taxiâ€™s location and then checks to see if it has reached its destination.<br>
 * If it has, it informs the dispatcher that it needs a new destination. Since both setLocation and notifyAvailable are synchronized, the thread calling setLocation acquires the Taxi lock and then the Dispatcher lock. Similarly, a thread calling getImage acquires the Dispatcher lock and then each Taxi lock (one at time).
