/**
 * <p>The Memoizer3 implementation is almost perfect: it exhibits very good concurrency (mostly derived from the excellent concurrency of ConcurrentHashMap),
 * the result is returned efficiently if it is already known, and if the computation is in progress by another thread, newly arriving threads wait patiently for the result.
 * <p>It has only one defectâ€”there is still a small window of vulnerability in which two threads might compute the same value. (nonatomic check-then-act sequence)
